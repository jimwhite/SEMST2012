insufferable but not insuperable

Tokenization trouble:

Wisteria_ch2 s187 (#532) : But the attempt was a dangerous one , and if Garcia did [N O T] return by a certain hour it was probable that his own life had been sacrificed .

Multitoken negation cues (in addition to #523):

Wisteria_ch1 s247 (#248) : " Remarkable , but [by no means] impossible , " said Holmes , smiling .

Non-contiguous multitoken negation cues:

Wisteria_ch1 s121 (#122) : The dinner itself was [neither] well served [nor] well cooked , and the gloomy presence of the taciturn servant did not help to enliven us .

Wisteria_ch1 s220 (#221) : There are [no] footsteps [nor] any clue to the criminals . "

(Self) echo q is not a negation:  

Wisteria_ch2 s189 (#534) : That would fully explain the facts , would it not ? "


fearless:  'fear' is the scope and event with a cue of 'less' in: 
	Wisteria_ch2 s325 (#670) : Strong , fearless , and energetic , he had sufficient virtue to enable him to impose his odious vices upon a cowering people for ten or twelve years .

But for something like "It was a fearless act." then scope would be to be "fear act" I think.


baskervilles01 s1 (#2) : Mr. Sherlock Holmes , who was usually very late in the mornings , save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night , was seated at the breakfast table .

"save upon" should be the cue but only "save" is tagged.  Or not I guess.  Aparently is in the synset of 'except'.

It appears again, but they miss it:

baskervilles09 s346 (#2160) : A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the rocks which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent it from being visible , save in the direction of Baskerville Hall .

The negation 'prevent' is tagged, but not 'save in the direction...'.  Or is that correct because it is double negation? (the candle is visible in the direction of the hall).

baskervilles04 s233 (#804) : No. 2704 is our man .

"No." is tagged as a cue but it is not negation (it is an abbreviation for Number).


Parse failure due to graph size limit:

baskervilles01 s30 (#31) : He had never said as much before , and I must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure , for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his methods .

This will parse (9354 edges):

I was piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his methods

So will this (15760 edges) - although the one-best tree doesn't look very convincing:

He had never said as much before , and I must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure , for I had often been piqued by his indifference

Discontiguous scope:

baskervilles03 s67 (#389) : `` [I could <not> call you in] , Mr. Holmes , [without disclosing these facts to the world], and I have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so .


Probable annotation error:

baskervilles09 s383 (#2197) : There was the sharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge of the moon , but its peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure .

The scope of "motionless" is just "motion" and "that".
